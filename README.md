## English

- `Subarray`
  - Contiguous subsequence
  - E.g. given `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `[1, 2, 3]` is subarray, but `[1, 2, 4]` isn't. It's subsequence of nums, but 2 
    and 4 are not contiguous, so it's not subarray.
- `Subsequence`
  - A sequence that can be derived from a given array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the
    remaining elements. Doesn't necessarily need to be contiguous.
- `Substring`
  - A **contiguous** non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
- `Palindrome`
  - A sequence of characters or numbers which reads the same backward as forward same
  - e.g. `121` is a palindrome, `123` isn't. `aba` is a palindrome, but `abc` isn't.
- `Pangram`
  - A sentence where every letter of the english alphabet appears at least once
- `Bipartition`
  - Having or consisting of two parts

## Communication

- Often times you don't need to code the brute force solution in interview if you can come up with a better solution.
- Just speak out the brute force approach.

## Design

- Have as less attributes as possible, even if attributes are convenient.
  - Less attributes mean that the manipulation logic is simpler and less error-prone.
  - Less space, so efficiency to the runtime performance.

## Follow-up

- Reducing the number of passes by loops is a very common follow-up.
  - e.g. Code contains 2 while loops. It's not `O(N^2)`, but `O(N)`, even if `O(2N) = O(N)` in analysis.

## Amortized Analysis

- Gives the average performance of each operation in the worst case.
- The worst case operation can alter the state in such a way that the worst case cannot occur again for a long time
  ("amortizing cost").

### Problems Requiring Amortized Analysis

- [173. Binary Search Tree Iterator](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/)

## Proof by Contradiction

### Example

- [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/solution/)

## Resource

- [Stable Sort](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV2g02zq5y7unJ_GSr-de2w/videos)
  - YouTube videos to understand complex algorithm concepts
- Elements of Programming Interviews in Python: The Insiders' Guide
  - The book that the people who apply for software engineer use to prepare for technical interviews.

## Blind Game

- A type of LeetCode problem where we don't have a direct access to the data.
- Instead, we are given API or custom class or function to get a partial information of the data.
- So unless interaction, we cannot find the answer.

### Example

- [1274. Number of Ships in a Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ships-in-a-rectangle/)

## Game

- [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))
  - [Play online](http://patorjk.com/games/snake/)
