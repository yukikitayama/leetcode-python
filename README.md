## Hash table

When you use modulo as hash function, the divisor should use prime number (e.g. 1999), because it can best avoid 
collision.

Integer, string and tuple are the Python valid dictionary keys. You cannot use list as key, because Python list is 
[mutable unhashable object](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-a-list-as-a-key-of-a-dictionary-in-python-3/). So first convert the list to tuple, and then use it as a key of the Python dictionary.

### Complexity

In the best case, the bucket size is small enough to be regarded as constant, so insertion and search are O(1). But in 
the worst case, all the items go to the same bucket and the size becomes N, so search time complexity will be O(N) while
insertion is still O(1).

If there are too many values in the same bucket, you should use `height-balanced binary search tree` instead. In the 
worst case, search and insertion time complexity is O(logN).

## Depth first search (DFS)

DFS is used 1. for traversing all the vertices in a graph, and 2. for traversing all the paths between two vertices.

DFS uses recursion call `stack`, LIFO, last in first out.

Often use visited set as helper data structure to avoid visiting the previously visited vertices.

### Complexity
Let V denote the number of vertices, and E the number of edges.
- Traversing all the vertices
  - Time is O(V + E) because it needs to check every vertex
    and traverse through every edge in the graph. 
  - Space is O(V) for the recursion call stack.
- Traversing all the paths
  - Time is O((V - 1)!). -1 because once a path reaches the target, from the target no more traverse occurs. Factorial !
    because, in the worst case, every vertex is connected to every other vertex (Complete graph), meaning that V - 1 
    paths from start to target, V - 2 paths from the next vertex from the start to target, continue...
  - Space is O(V^3), because it comes from O((V(V - 1)/2 + 1) * V). V(V - 1)/2 + 1 comes from (V - 1) paths appended by
    (V - 2) paths, appended by (V - 3), ..., and * V comes from each path added to the stack taking O(V) space (?, need
    review).

## Minimum spanning tree

- **Spanning tree** is a subgraph in a graph where all the vertices are connected with the minimum number of edges. 

- **Minimum spanning tree** is a spanning tree with the minimum total edge weight. 

- Spanning tree is in an undirected graph, and minimum spanning tree is in a weighted undirected graph. Those graphs could
have multiple (minimum) spanning trees.

- **Cut** is a partition of vertices in a graph into two disjoint subsets. 
  - Cut has **crossing edges** which connect a vertex in one disjoint subset with another vertex in the other disjoint 
    subset. 
  - Among the crossing edges, if you choose the edge with the smallest weight, it belongs to minimum spanning tree. This
    is called **cut property**.

### Kruskal's algorithm

An algorithm to make a minimum spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph.

#### Algorithm
1. Sort a list of edges in the ascending order by weight.
2. Add an edge in the order to minimum spanning tree.
   - Skip the current edge if it makes a cycle.
3. Repeat until N - 1 edeges are added. 
   - N - 1 because, if it's more than N - 1, it has too many edges to be spanning tree.

#### Complexity
Time is O(E * logE), because sorting edges take O(E * logE), and for each edge, checking whether two vertices belong to 
the same connected component take O(E * &alpha;(V)), so O(E * logE + E * &alpha;(V)) = O(E * logE). &alpha;() is the 
inverse ackerman function.

Space is O(V), because it needs union find data structure to keep track of the root of every vertex.

## Disjoint set
Disjoint set = union-find. The goal is 1. to find whether two vertices share a common ancestor, and 2. connect two 
vertices. Disjoint set is optimized by implementing union by rank and path compression. Implementation of Disjoint set
is highly modularized, so it's good to just memorize the implementation of disjoint set with union by rank and path
compression.

Template: [Disjoint Set Python code](https://github.com/yukikitayama/leetcode-python/blob/main/disjoint-set-union-find/DisjointSet.py)

Union by rank is to limit the maximum height of each vertex to improve find() time complexity. Find the height (rank) of
the root nodes and choose the bigger rank root node as the root node in union().

Path compression is to update a parent node with a root node in find() to improve find() time complexity by avoiding
taking O(N) every time in calling find().

### Method
- find(vertex)
  - Find the root node of a given vertex.
- union(vertex1, vertex2)
  - Connect two vertices by making their root nodes the same.

### Complexity
- Optimized disjoint set with union by rank and path compression
  - Constructor is O(N) to make parent array and rank array.
  - find() is O(alpha(N)), where alpha() is the Inverse Ackermann function
    - O(alpha(N)) is regarded as O(1) on average.
  - union() is O(alpha(N))
  - Space is O(N) for the two arrays.
- Quick find
  - Parent array stores root vertex, not parent vertex.
  - For time, find() is O(1), but union() is O(N) because it needs to iterate parent array to update root node.
  - Space is O(N) for the parent array.
- Quick union
  - find() keep searching root node while a parent of the current node is not the current node.
  - union() uses either the found root node as a parent. The root is found by find().
  - Both find() and union() takes O(logN)
  - Quick union is more efficient than quick find, because to union all the nodes, quick find takes N * O(N) union, 
    but quick union takes less than or equal to N * O(N) because find() of quick union updates root nodes.

### Terminology
- Parent node
  - The direct parent node of a vertex. For example, 0 (Root) - 1 - 3, The parent node of 3 is 1.
- Root node
  - A node without a parent node. In the above example, 0 is a root node.
