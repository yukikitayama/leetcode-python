# SQL

- Filter records which have missing
  - `WHERE column_name IS NULL`
- If a value in a column is null, replace with something
  - `IFNULL(column_name, 0)` e.g. Replace with 0 if it's missing
- Create a new column based on the other column value

```
CASE 
  WHEN condition_from_other_column THEN value
  WHEN condition_from_other_column THEN value
  ELSE value
END
```
- Make a new table without `FROM`
  - Use `SELECT` and `UNION ALL`. e.g. The below makes a table with one column 'col' with values 'a' and 'b' for each 
    row.
  - [1435. Create a Session Bar Chart](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-a-session-bar-chart/)
```
SELECT 'a' AS col
UNION ALL
SELECT 'b' AS col
```

## GROUP_CONCAT()

- Concatenate string from a group into a single string with options such as separator.
- e.g. `GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT col ORDER BY col separator ',')`
  - `seperator ','` can be omitted because by default ',' is a separator.

## Percentage

- Use `AVG()` and `CASE WHEN` to convert a column into binary

```sql
select
  round(
    avg(
      case when column = 'something' 
        then 1 
        else 0 
      end), 
    2) 
  as percentage
from
  some_table
```

## IS NULL for 3-Valued Logic

- MySQL uses 3-valued logic, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `UNKNOWN`
- Anything compared to `NULL` evaluates to the 3rd value `UNKNOWN`
- For example, `where column != 1` only returns rows which have non-null value and not 1
  - If a row has null in the column, this row will not be returned.
  - If we wanna return this null row as well, `where column != 1 or column is null`

## Optimization

  - [simple MySQL solution (Visits.visit_id not in (SELECT visit_id FROM Transactions))](https://leetcode.com/problems/customer-who-visited-but-did-not-make-any-transactions/discuss/841000/simple-MySQL-solution-(Visits.visit_id-not-in-(SELECT-visit_id-FROM-Transactions)))
  - Comments in the above discussion discuss why `LEFT JOIN` is better than `NOT IN` subquery in this problem
  - Sub query runs earlier than main query.
  - Subquery returns a list and in where clause for each item checks against the list, so not optimized

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# select
#   customer_id,
#   count(*) as count_no_trans
# from
#   visits
# where
#   visit_id not in (
#     select visit_id from transactions
#   )
# group by
#   customer_id
# ;

select
  a.customer_id,
  count(a.visit_id) as count_no_trans
from
  visits as a
left join
  transactions as b
on
  a.visit_id = b.visit_id
where
  b.transaction_id is null
group by
  a.customer_id
```

## DATEDIFF()

- `DATEDIFF(later_date, earlier_date)`
- This can be used in where clause like `where datediff(later_date, earlier_date) = 1` to find yesterday data.

## MOD

- `MOD(dividend (numerator), divisor (denominator))` returns `remainder` of a number divided by another number

## Common Table Expression

- [13.2.15 WITH (Common Table Expressions)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html)
- Multiple common table expressions
  - If table contains both recursive and non-recursive, put `RECURSIVE` right after `WITH`



## Rank

- `order by` can use `desc` after column name

```
rank() over(
  partition by
    WITHIN-GROUP_TO_ASSIGN_RANK
  order by
    COLUMN_TO_REFER_TO_MAKE_RANK 
) as RANK_COLUMN_NAME
```

## DENSE_RANK() vs RANK()

- [MySQL DENSE_RANK Function](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-window-functions/mysql-dense_rank-function/)
- `DENSE_RANK()` returns **consecutive rank**, but `RANK()` will skip a number when a tie exists.

## Recursive Common Table Expression

- A common table expression using `with recursive` and having a subquery inside referring to its own table

## MIN() vs LEAST()

- `MIN()` is typically used to return the minimum value in a column in a database. The table could contain many rows, but this function returns the one with the minimum value.
- `LEAST()` on the other hand, returns the minimum-valued argument from the list of arguments passed to it. So you could pass say, 3 arguments to this function and it will return the one with the smallest value.

## Day of week

- `DAYOFWEEK(date)` returns 1 (Sunday), 2 (Monday), ... 7 (Saturday)
- `WEEKDAY(date)` returns 0 (Monday), 1 (Tuesday), ... 6 (Sunday)

## REGEXP

- `REGEXP` performs regular expression pattern matches.
- `^ab` means starts with 'ab' like 'abc', not 'acc'
- Use two backslashes `\\` to use literal instance of special characters.
  - To match '-', `\\-`
- `abc$` means ends with 'abc'
- `*` means 0 or more instances of string preceding it. `a*` is 'a', 'aa', or ''.
