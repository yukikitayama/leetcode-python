# Binary Search Tree (BST)

- A special form of a binary tree
- The value in each node is 
  - greater than (or equal to) any values in its left subtree, 
  - and less than (or equal to) any values in its right subtree.
- `Inorder traversal` in a BST is in `ascending order`
- `Inorder successor` in a BST
