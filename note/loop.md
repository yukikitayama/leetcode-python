# Loop

## While break else

`while` loop can use with `else`. When the `while` condition no longer is true, a block of code after `else` statement 
runs once.

However, when `break` is used in `while`, `else` block won't be executed. So `else` clause is executed if you exit a 
block normally, like not by `break`, `return`, raise an exception.
