# Disjoint set

Disjoint set = union-find. The goal is 1. to find whether two vertices share a common ancestor, and 2. connect two 
vertices. Disjoint set is optimized by implementing union by rank and path compression. Implementation of Disjoint set
is highly modularized, so it's good to just memorize the implementation of disjoint set with union by rank and path
compression.

Union by rank is to limit the maximum height of each vertex to improve find() time complexity. Find the height (rank) of
the root nodes and choose the bigger rank root node as the root node in union().

Path compression is to update a parent node with a root node in find() to improve find() time complexity by avoiding
taking O(N) every time in calling find().

## LeetCode

- [305. Number of Islands II](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands-ii/description)

## Method
- find(vertex)
  - Find the root node of a given vertex.
- union(vertex1, vertex2)
  - Connect two vertices by making their root nodes the same.

## Complexity
- Optimized disjoint set with union by rank and path compression
  - Constructor is O(N) to make parent array and rank array.
  - find() is O(alpha(N)), where alpha() is the Inverse Ackermann function
    - O(alpha(N)) is regarded as O(1) on average.
  - union() is O(alpha(N))
  - Space is O(N) for the two arrays.
- Quick find
  - Parent array stores root vertex, not parent vertex.
  - For time, find() is O(1), but union() is O(N) because it needs to iterate parent array to update root node.
  - Space is O(N) for the parent array.
- Quick union
  - find() keep searching root node while a parent of the current node is not the current node.
  - union() uses either the found root node as a parent. The root is found by find().
  - Both find() and union() takes O(logN)
  - Quick union is more efficient than quick find, because to union all the nodes, quick find takes N * O(N) union, 
    but quick union takes less than or equal to N * O(N) because find() of quick union updates root nodes.

## Terminology
- Parent node
  - The direct parent node of a vertex. For example, 0 (Root) - 1 - 3, The parent node of 3 is 1.
- Root node
  - A node without a parent node. In the above example, 0 is a root node.
