# Shortest Path

## Dijkstra's algorithm

**Relaxation** means for each neighbor of the current vertex, calculate the distance through the current vertex, and if the calculated distance is less than the previously known distance to the neighbor, the distance is updated.

## Bellman-ford algorithm

## Shortest path first algorithm (SPFA)

## Floyd-warshall algorithm
