## Backtracking

- Find every possible patterns or ways
- If we are only interested in the number of patterns or ways, consider using dynamic programming, because generating 
  every possible patterns is time-consuming.
- **When constraint is like 1 < n <= 16**, time complexity is okay with using backtracking.
