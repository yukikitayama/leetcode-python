# Greedy

- Decisions are made step by step, focusing on what seems best in the moment to reach the overall best solution.
- The idea of greedy algorithm is to pick the locally optimal move at each step, and it will lead to the globally 
  optimal solution.
- Greedy problem usually look like "Find minimum number f something to do something" or "Find maximum number of 
  something to fit in some condition", and typically propose an unsorted input
