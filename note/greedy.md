## Greedy

- The idea of greedy algorithm is to pick the locally optimal move at each step, and it will lead to the globally 
  optimal solution.
- Greedy problem usually look like "Find minimum number f something to do something" or "Find maximum number of 
  something to fit in some condition", and typically propose an unsorted input
